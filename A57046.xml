            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T pleaſed the LORD, in the deep of his Wiſe dome and over-ruling Providence, ſo to diſpoſe, that, upon the 17. of <hi>June</hi> laſt, 1652. being Thurſday, a little before two of the clock in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon, a ſudden and violent fire brake up within a narrow cloſſe, upon the Eaſt ſide of the ſtreet above the Croſſe, which, within a ſhort ſpace, burnt up ſix cloſſes with diverſe conſiderable buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings upon the fore-ſtreet. And while the inhabitants of the neighbouring places of the Town were flocked together for the removall of the goods that could be gotten from amongſt the fire, and hindering, ſo far as in them lay, the ſpreading of the ſame: the wind, blowing from the North-Eaſt, carried ſuch ſparks of the flamme as kindled unexſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctedly
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:35584:2"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 19 -->ſome houſes on the Weſt ſide of the Salt-Mercat, where the fire ſo ſpred, that it did overrun all from houſe to houſe, and conſumed in ſome few hours what came in its way, not only Houſes, but Goods alſo, both of the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of that ſtreet, and of others likewiſe, who, when the fire began upon them, had brought to that place theſe of their Goods and Moveables which were gotten ſafe from the fire that firſt ſeiſed upon them. This fire, by the hand of GOD, was carried ſo from the one ſide of that ſtreet to the other, that it was totally conſumed on both ſides: and in it the far beſt and moſt conſiderable Buildings in the Town, with all the Chops and Ware-houſes of the Merchants which were therein; And from that ſtreet the flamme was carried to the Tron-gait, Gallow-gait and Bridg-gait: In all which ſtreets a great many of conſiderable Cloſſes and Buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, with the beſt part of the moveables and commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Inhabitants, were burnt to aſhes. This ſad diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation, from the Hand of an angry GOD, continued neer by eighten hours, before the great violence of the fire began to abate. In this ſhort time, a great number of thoſe who were wealthy before were extreamly impoveriſhed, many Merchants and others neer by ruined; a very conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable number of Widows, Orphans and honeſt Families, were brought to extream miſery, the Dwellings of almoſt a thouſand Families were utterly conſumed, and many of theſe, who had a large Patrimonie, and oftimes had been a ſhelter to others in their ſtraits, had not themſelves a place where to cover their head, or knew wherewith to provide bread for them and their families, That which was preſerved from the violence of the fire, being caſt out in the open ſtreet, and by frequent removings thereof from one place to another, and from that to a third, and from a third place to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:35584:2"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 19 -->a fourth, as the fire occaſioned, ſo that it was either taken away by ſtealth, which in ſuch a confuſion was inevitable: or in a great part ſo ſpoiled, that it was made utterly unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable.</p>
            <p>When ſome hundreths of Families, in great diſtreſſe and wants, had, till the Saturnday at night, lyen in the open fields, and diverſe of them were beginning to get ſome ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with ſuch of their neighbours as the LORD had ſpared: Upon the LORDS Day, betwixt ſeven and eight in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, the fire brake up anew in the North ſide of the Tron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gait, and continued burning violently till neer by twelve hours in the fore-noon. This new and ſad ſtroke, upon the back of the other, not only deſtroyed diverſe Dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling-houſes, and occaſioned the pulling down of many more<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but it ſo terrified the whole Inhabitants, that all carried out of their houſes what moveables they had, and took themſelves again for ſome nights to the open fields; And in this fear, and removing of their goods from their houſes to the ſtreets, and from the ſtreets to the fields, the loſſe by ſtealing and ſpoiling of goods was very great to all: and diverſe, on whom the fire unexſpectedly ſeiſed, were altogether ruined.</p>
            <p>As we deſire to acknowledge the Juſtice of the LORD in this terrible ſtroke, having miniſtred ſo much fewell to the fire of his indignation that burns ſo hot againſt the whole Land: and to mourn under His heavy diſpleaſure, that His further wrath againſt us may, in his Sonne, be averted; So are we neceſſitate earneſtly to intreat for cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable and timous ſupplie from our Chriſtian Brethren and Neighbours, whom we do in all humility requeſt, if there be any conſolation in CHRIST, if any comfort of love, if any fellowſhip of the Spirit, if any bowels and mercies,

               <!-- PDF PAGE 20 -->That they would tenderly lay to heart, and conſider the deſolate condition of the poor Inhabitants of this afflicted Citie, and, with cheerfulneſſe and a willing minde, in due ſeaſon, caſt ſome of their ſeed upon theſe many waters, for the refreſhment of us who are ready to faint in this our languiſhing condition. As GOD hath given every one abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, ſo we hope they will give; A very mite, from a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling minde of theſe who can do no more, will be accepted of the LORD, will be to us comfortable, and, we are confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, will be no ſmall matter of joy to themſelves, in the day of their accounts, that, in this ſo conſiderable an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of charitie, they have not hid themſelves from their own fleſh.</p>
